# A simple blog system with user and article administration

This is a personal practice for font-end and back-end. 

Before to run this applcation, please download the back-end server from the repo of blogServer

The front-end can be download directly and run with the following command: 

## `npm install`

This is to set the executive envrionment for the application with package.json

## `npm start`

After this command, the front-end will be launched on the default broswer automaticly
